    """
    This function takes a list of cows and their weights and milk production rates. Then finds which group of cows
    produces the highest amount of milk without exceding the maximum total weight.

    The implemented algorithm consists in two stages:
        - Decent solution stage: Here the cows are sorted by efficiency (milk production/weight rate), then the most
                 efficient cows are selected (without exceding the max weight).
                 Two groups are created:
                     - The picked cows: These form part of the proposed solution.
                     - The non picked cows: These are the ones we did not select.

        - Solution improvement: Here we try to obtain a better solution by comparing the cows who were not picked in the
                                first solution with those picked.
                                If one of those comparisons reveals that we can exchange a non picked cow and a picked
                                one while:
                                    - We keep the total weight below the maximum.
                                    - The exchange increases the total milk production of the picked cow set.
                                Then we make that exchange and start comparing the picked and not picked cow sets.

    It is interesting to note that the first stage is not completely necessary. However, begining the improvement stage
    with a better solution than a random one may reduce the amount of operations needed to complete the improvement
    stage. That is why it was included.

    :param n_cows: Total amount of cows in the market.
    :param max_weight: Maximum weight the truck can handle.
    :param cow_weight_list: List of cow weights.
    :param cow_milk_production: List of the milk production of each cow.
    :return: The total milk production from the picked cows.
